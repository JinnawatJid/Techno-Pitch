# Research Findings & Strategic Recommendations

## 1. Executive Summary
Our research confirms that **ShopDer is solving the right problem at the right time.** The market for second-hand fashion in Thailand is booming (22.8% CAGR [1]), driven by Gen Z's desire for sustainability and uniqueness. However, current platforms (FB Marketplace, Kaidee, Instagram) are failing this demographic due to trust issues, poor discovery, and boring interfaces.

## 2. The "Beachhead" Market Recommendation
We strongly recommend launching with **Gen Z Women's Fashion** as the initial beachhead market.
*   **Why:** High volume, high frequency, highly visual (perfect for swiping), and this demographic is already trained to buy from social feeds (TikTok/IG).
*   **Why not Gadgets/Furniture?:** Lower frequency, higher trust barrier, harder to ship. Fashion is the "gateway drug" to the platform.

## 3. The Green Living Lab Connection
**"Fashion is the #2 Polluter. We make saving the planet addictive."**
We are not just a shopping app; we are a behavioral science experiment (a "Green Living Lab") designed to shift consumption from *New* to *Pre-loved*.

*   **The Environmental Crisis:**
    *   Fashion is responsible for **10% of global carbon emissions** (more than international flights and maritime shipping combined) [4].
    *   **92 million tonnes** of textile waste end up in landfills every year [5].
    *   The number of times a garment is worn has declined by **36% in 15 years** [5], fueling a "throwaway culture."

*   **The ShopDer Solution (Green Gamification):**
    *   **The "Carbon Score":** Every item on ShopDer displays a "Carbon Saved" badge (e.g., "Buying this shirt saved 5kg of CO2 vs. buying new").
    *   **The Green Leaderboard:** Users compete to see who is the "Top Saver." This turns sustainability from a chore into a status symbol.
    *   **Impact:** By making second-hand shopping *fun* (swiping) and *rewarding* (leaderboards), we reduce the demand for Fast Fashion.

## 4. Recommended Slide Content (Data-Backed)

### Slide 2: The Problem
**"Second-Hand Shopping feels like work, not fun."**
*   **The Hunt is Hard:** On FB/Kaidee, you have to *search* for a needle in a haystack. There is no "feed" to inspire you.
*   **The Trust Gap:** "Will I get scammed?" is the #1 fear [2].
*   **The Boredom Factor:** Listing items is a chore. Buying items is a spreadsheet exercise.
*   *Data Point:* 67% of Gen Z shop on impulse when they see something cool (Discovery Commerce), but current platforms are built for *Search Commerce* (Intent-based) [3].

### Slide 3: Customer Segment
**The "Eco-Conscious Trendsetter" (Gen Z, 18-28)**
*   **Identity:** University students & First jobbers.
*   **Behavior:** Spends 3+ hours on TikTok/IG daily. Buys clothes to wear once for a photo, then resells.
*   **Values:** Wants to be "Sustainable" but won't sacrifice "Style" or "Price."
*   **Pain Point:** Loves thrifting but hates digging through piles of clothes (offline) or scrolling through unorganized FB groups (online).

### Slide 5: Unique Value Proposition (UVP)
**"Swipe Right to Save the Planet"**
*   **Gamified Discovery:** We turn shopping into a game. Swipe left to ignore, Swipe right to bag. It's addictive.
*   **Trust-First:** We hold the money until the buyer confirms receipt (escrow), solving the #1 pain point of FB Marketplace.
*   **Green Living Lab:** Every swipe right is a vote for the planet. We show you the "Carbon Saved" for every item you buy.

## 5. Next Steps

*   **Confirm:** Does the "Eco-Conscious Trendsetter" persona resonate with your team?
