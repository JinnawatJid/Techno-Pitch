# Research Findings & Strategic Recommendations

## 1. Executive Summary
Our research confirms that **ShopDer is solving the right problem at the right time.** The market for second-hand fashion in Thailand is booming (22.8% CAGR), driven by Gen Z's desire for sustainability and uniqueness. However, current platforms (FB Marketplace, Kaidee, Instagram) are failing this demographic due to trust issues, poor discovery, and boring interfaces.

## 2. The "Beachhead" Market Recommendation
We strongly recommend launching with **Gen Z Women's Fashion** as the initial beachhead market.
*   **Why:** High volume, high frequency, highly visual (perfect for swiping), and this demographic is already trained to buy from social feeds (TikTok/IG).
*   **Why not Gadgets/Furniture?:** Lower frequency, higher trust barrier, harder to ship. Fashion is the "gateway drug" to the platform.

### Slide 2: The Problem
**"Second-Hand Shopping feels like work, not fun."**
*   **The Hunt is Hard:** On FB/Kaidee, you have to *search* for a needle in a haystack. There is no "feed" to inspire you.
*   **The Trust Gap:** "Will I get scammed?" is the #1 fear.
*   **The Boredom Factor:** Listing items is a chore. Buying items is a spreadsheet exercise.
*   *Data Point:* 67% of Gen Z shop on impulse when they see something cool (Discovery Commerce), but current platforms are built for *Search Commerce* (Intent-based).

### Slide 3: Customer Segment
**The "Eco-Conscious Trendsetter" (Gen Z, 18-28)**
*   **Identity:** University students & First jobbers.
*   **Behavior:** Spends 3+ hours on TikTok/IG daily. Buys clothes to wear once for a photo, then resells.
*   **Values:** Wants to be "Sustainable" but won't sacrifice "Style" or "Price."
*   **Pain Point:** Loves thrifting but hates digging through piles of clothes (offline) or scrolling through unorganized FB groups (online).

### Slide 5: Unique Value Proposition (UVP)
**"Swipe Right to Save the Planet"**
*   **Gamified Discovery:** We turn shopping into a game. Swipe left to ignore, Swipe right to bag. It's addictive.
*   **Trust-First:** We hold the money until the buyer confirms receipt (escrow), solving the #1 pain point of FB Marketplace.
*   **Green Living Lab:** Every swipe right is a vote for the planet. We show you the "Carbon Saved" for every item you buy.
