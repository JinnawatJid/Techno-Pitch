### **[0:00 - 0:45] Slide 1 & 2: The Hook - The Hidden Cost of "Fast"**
*(Display Slide 1: Title & Slide 2: The Problem - Mountains of Waste)*

**Speaker:**
"Good afternoon.

Did you know that right now, as we speak, **92 million tonnes** of textile waste are being dumped into landfills every single year? Fashion is now the **second-largest polluter on Earth**, responsible for **10% of global carbon emissions**.

We are drowning in clothes we don't wear. The average garment is worn **36% less often** today than just 15 years ago.

The problem isn't that we don't *want* to be sustainable. The problem is that being sustainable is **hard, boring, and risky**."

### **[0:45 - 1:30] Slide 2 & 3: The Friction - Why Current Solutions Fail**
*(Display Slide 3: Screenshots of messy Facebook Marketplace & Kaidee)*

**Speaker:**
"Meet 'Ploy', a 22-year-old eco-conscious student. She wants to buy second-hand. But where does she go?

*   **Facebook Marketplace?** It's the Wild West. Scams are everywhere. "Trust" is non-existent.
*   **Kaidee?** It feels like reading a newspaper classified. She has to *search* for a needle in a haystack.

Currently, saving the planet feels like a chore. And that friction sends Ploy right back to Shein to buy a 100 baht t-shirt that falls apart in two washes."

### **[1:30 - 2:15] Slide 4 & 5: The Solution - Making Green Addictive**
*(Display Slide 4: App Demo & Slide 5: UVP - Swipe Mechanics)*

**Speaker:**
"What if we could make buying second-hand as addictive as TikTok?

Introducing **ShopDer**. Think of it as **Shopee meets Tinder** for the Circular Economy.

We turned 'Searching' into 'Discovery'.
*   **Swipe Left** if it's not your style.
*   **Swipe Right** if you love it. It goes straight to your basket.
*   **Swipe Up** for video details.

But here is our secret sauce: **The Green Living Lab**.
Every item on ShopDer has a **Carbon Score**. When Ploy swipes right on that vintage jacket, she doesn't just get a cool look; she gets points on our 'Green Leaderboard'. She can see she saved **5kg of CO2** this month.

We made sustainability a game that you want to win."

### **[2:15 - 3:00] Slide 6 & 7: The Opportunity - Riding the Gen Z Wave**
*(Display Slide 6: Unfair Advantage & Slide 7: Target User)*

**Speaker:**
"Is there a market for this? Absolutely.
The second-hand fashion market in Thailand is projected to grow at **22.8% annually**, reaching nearly **$18 Billion by 2031**.

Gen Z holds **2.6 Trillion Baht** in purchasing power. 71% of them prefer to buy online, and **67% shop on impulse**. They are already buying from social feeds. We are just giving them a dedicated, safe platform to do it.

Our beachhead is clear: The **Eco-Conscious Trendsetter**. She wants to be green, but she demands style and convenience."

### **[3:00 - 3:45] Slide 8 & 9: Positioning & Business Model**
*(Display Slide 8: 2x2 Matrix & Slide 9: Revenue)*

**Speaker:**
"Unlike Facebook, we offer **Trust** through held payments (Escrow).
Unlike Kaidee, we offer **Discovery** through our AI-driven feed.
We are the only player in the **High Trust + High Discovery** quadrant.

**How do we make money?**
1.  **Commission:** A small transaction fee (3-5%) on every successful sale.
2.  **'Boost' Features:** Sellers pay to get more views in the swipe deck.
3.  **Green Data:** In the future, we provide brands with insights on what Gen Z is *actually* reusing."

### **[3:45 - 4:30] Slide 10: Go-to-Market Strategy**
*(Display Slide 10: Channels)*

**Speaker:**
"How do we grow? We meet Gen Z where they are:
1.  **Social Ads:** TikTok & Instagram Reels showing 'Thrift Flips'.
2.  **Campus Ambassadors:** Recruiting 'Green Leaders' in universities to drive initial adoption.
3.  **Influencer Partnerships:** Fashion haulers showing off their ShopDer finds."

### **[4:30 - 5:00] The Ask & Close**
*(Display Slide 11: The Team & Ask)*

**Speaker:**
"We are currently in the concept phase, building our MVP to test with 1,000 university students in Bangkok next month.

We are looking for **partners and seed funding** to help us build the technology that turns trash into treasure.

Don't just buy clothes. Join the **Green Living Lab**. Let's make saving the planet the coolest trend in Thailand.

Thank you. Khob Khun Krub."
