# Pitch Deck Critique & Recommendations

## Executive Summary
The current `Pitch Deck Presentation.pdf` provides a solid functional skeleton for the ShopDer product, clearly outlining the mechanics (Swipe, Green Points) and the business model. However, it currently lacks the **narrative drive** and **emotional hook** needed to capture an investor's attention.

The deck focuses heavily on *what* the app does, but misses the *why*—the urgent environmental crisis and the unique "Green Living Lab" mission that differentiates ShopDer from just another marketplace.

**Key Recommendation:** Shift the focus from "Features" to "Value." Use the "Green Living Lab" concept to frame the app not just as a store, but as a movement.

## Slide-by-Slide Analysis

### Slide 1: Title
*   **Current:** (Presumed Title)
*   **Critique:** Ensure the tagline is punchy.
*   **Recommendation:** Use a strong tagline like: *"ShopDer: Tinder for Sustainable Fashion"* or *"Turning Discovery into Sustainability."*

### Slide 2 & 3: The Problem
*   **Current:** Raw notes in Thai about waste and second-hand value.
*   **Critique:** This is the most critical slide. It needs to make the audience feel the pain. Raw notes are placeholders.
*   **Recommendation:** Focus on two problems:
    1.  **The Environmental Crisis:** Fashion is the #2 polluter (92m tonnes of waste).
    2.  **The User Friction:** Buying green is *boring* and *risky* on current platforms (scams, hard to search).
    *   *Action:* Replace notes with the "Friction vs. Fun" narrative from the script.

### Slide 4: Application (The Solution)
*   **Current:** "Home Page, Swipe Page, Category Page, Profile Page"
*   **Critique:** Functional labels are boring.
*   **Recommendation:** Show, don't just tell. Use captions that explain the *benefit*.
    *   Instead of "Swipe Page," use **"Addictive Discovery (Swipe Right)."**
    *   Instead of "Profile Page," use **"Your Green Impact Tracker."**

### Slide 5: Unique Value Propositions (UVP)
*   **Current:** Lists features (Swipe, CO2, Green Points).
*   **Critique:** Good features, but needs to be tied to the "Green Living Lab" concept more explicitly.
*   **Recommendation:** Group these into three pillars:
    1.  **Fun:** Swipe Mechanics (Gamification).
    2.  **Trust:** Escrow Payments (Safety).
    3.  **Purpose:** Carbon Score (Green Living Lab).

### Slide 6: Unfair Advantage & Market
*   **Current:** Mentions "Second-hand Market" and "User Behavior Data."
*   **Critique:** It's vague. Investors love numbers.
*   **Recommendation:** Inject the hard data from our research:
    *   **Market Size:** $18 Billion by 2031.
    *   **Growth:** 22.8% CAGR.
    *   **Gen Z Power:** 2.6 Trillion Baht purchasing power.

### Slide 7: Target User
*   **Current:** 1. Eco-conscious, 2. Gen Z, 3. Resellers.
*   **Critique:** A bit broad. "Gen Z" is a huge group.
*   **Recommendation:** Focus on the "Beachhead" persona: **"The Eco-Conscious Trendsetter."**
    *   *Why:* She buys fast fashion because it's easy, but *wants* to be green. ShopDer makes green easy.

### Slide 8: Market Positioning
*   **Current:** Reliability vs. Unreliability / Complicated vs. Uncomplicated.
*   **Critique:** "Complicated" is a weak axis.
*   **Recommendation:** Use **"Discovery vs. Search"** (X-axis) and **"Trust vs. Wild West"** (Y-axis).
    *   ShopDer is **High Discovery + High Trust**.
    *   Kaidee is High Search + High Trust.
    *   Facebook is High Discovery + Low Trust.

### Slide 9: Revenue Stream
*   **Current:** Commission (3-5%) and Subscriptions.
*   **Critique:** Solid model.
*   **Recommendation:** Keep it simple. Highlight that the "Green Data" (selling consumer insights to brands) is a future exponential revenue stream.

### Slide 10: Channels
*   **Current:** Social Media Ads.
*   **Critique:** Standard.
*   **Recommendation:** Add "University Ambassadors" or "Campus Partners" to align with the Gen Z target.

### Missing Slides
*   **The Team:** Who is building this? (Critical for early-stage).
*   **The Ask:** What do you want? (Funding? Partners? Mentors?).

## Action Plan
1.  **Restructure Research Notes:** I will update `RESEARCH_FINDINGS.md` to map directly to these 10 slides, ensuring every claim is backed by data.
2.  **Update Script:** I will rewrite `PITCH_SCRIPT.md` to follow this improved flow, ensuring the speaker hits the emotional high notes that the slides might miss visually.
