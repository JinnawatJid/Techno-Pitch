### **[0:00 - 0:45] The Hook: The Hidden Cost of "Fast"**
*(Display Slide 1: A massive pile of discarded clothes in a landfill)*

**Speaker:**
"Good afternoon everyone. Did you know that the fashion industry is now the second-largest polluter in the world? Right now, as we speak, **92 million tonnes** of textile waste are being dumped into landfills every single year.

This isn't just waste; it's a failure of imagination. We *know* we should reuse. We *know* we should be green. But why don't we?

Because doing the right thing... is currently **boring, difficult, and risky**."

### **[0:45 - 1:30] The Problem: The "Friction" in Circular Economy**
*(Display Slide 2: Screenshots of messy Facebook Marketplace posts and a confusing Kaidee search bar)*

**Speaker:**
"Meet 'Ploy', a 22-year-old university student. Ploy wants to be sustainable. She wants to buy unique, pre-loved clothes instead of fast fashion.

But where does she go?
*   **Facebook Marketplace?** It's the Wild West. Scams are rampant. She has to message 10 sellers just to get one reply.
*   **Kaidee?** It feels like reading a newspaper classified. She has to *search* for a needle in a haystack. It's work, not fun.
*   **Instagram?** She has to follow 50 different shops just to see a few items.

Currently, saving the planet feels like a chore. And that is why Ploy goes back to Shein and buys a 100 baht t-shirt that falls apart in two washes."

### **[1:30 - 2:30] The Solution: Making Green Addictive**
*(Display Slide 4: A video demo of ShopDer - Swiping Right on a cool jacket)*

**Speaker:**
"What if we could make buying second-hand as addictive as TikTok?

Introducing **ShopDer** (ช็อปเด้อ). Think of it as **Shopee meets Tinder** for the Circular Economy.

We turned 'Searching' into 'Discovery'.
*   **Swipe Left** if it's not your style.
*   **Swipe Right** if you love it. It goes straight to your basket.
*   **Swipe Up** to see the video details.

But here is the secret sauce: **The Green Living Lab**.
Every item on ShopDer has a **Carbon Score**. When Ploy buys that jacket, she doesn't just get a jacket; she gets points on our 'Green Leaderboard'. She can show off to her friends that she saved 5kg of CO2 this month.

We made sustainability a game that you want to win."

### **[2:30 - 3:30] Market & Traction: The "Gen Z" Opportunity**
*(Display Slide 7: The 2x2 Matrix - Trust vs. Discovery)*

**Speaker:**
"Is there a market for this? Absolutely.
The second-hand fashion market in Thailand is projected to grow at **22.8% annually**, reaching nearly **$18 Billion by 2031**.

Gen Z holds **2.6 Trillion Baht** in purchasing power, and 71% of them prefer to buy online. They are already buying from social feeds. We are just giving them a dedicated, safe platform to do it.

Unlike Facebook, we offer **Trust** (Held Payments).
Unlike Kaidee, we offer **Discovery** (AI-driven Feed).
We are the only player in the **High Trust + High Discovery** quadrant."

### **[3:30 - 4:15] Business Model: How We Scale**
*(Display Slide 8: Revenue Streams)*

**Speaker:**
"How do we make money?
1.  **Commission:** A small transaction fee (5-10%) on every successful sale, paid by the seller for the safety and reach we provide.
2.  **'Boost' Features:** Sellers can pay to have their items appear more frequently in the swipe deck.
3.  **Green Data:** In the future, we provide brands with data on what Gen Z is *actually* reusing, helping them design better products."

### **[4:15 - 5:00] The Ask & Close**
*(Display Slide 10: The Team & Contact Info)*

**Speaker:**
"We are currently in the concept phase, building our MVP to test with 1,000 university students in Bangkok next month.

We are looking for [Partners/Seed Funding/Mentorship] to help us build the technology that will turn trash into treasure.

Don't just buy clothes. Join the **Green Living Lab**. Let's make saving the planet the coolest trend in Thailand.

Thank you. Khob Khun Krub."
