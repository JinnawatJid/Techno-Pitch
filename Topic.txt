Hey jules, currently I planning to develop the ShopDer (ช็อปเด้อ) the second hand focus e commerce platform which if we need to describe the analogy it's like a shopee + tinder = Shopder, Tinder for E Commerce Shopping

We introduce the way to shopping by swipe left (ignore) swipe right (interest in this and put it in the basket) so currently we in the idea & concept phase

I need you to document how we going to de it (help me plan how could I make it work) could you help?
