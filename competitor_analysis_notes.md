## Competitor Analysis: The "Friction" in Current Platforms

### 1. Facebook Marketplace
*   **The Wild West:** It's the biggest platform but also the most dangerous.
*   **Core Pain Points:**
    *   **Trust/Scams:** "Got scammed FB Marketplace" is a top search. Users fear paying before receiving goods.
    *   **Ghosting:** "Is this available?" messages with no reply are rampant.
    *   **Search Fatigue:** You have to know exactly what you want. It's not a place to "browse for fun" in a curated way.

### 2. Kaidee (The Old Giant)
*   **The "Classifieds" Model:** It feels like a digital newspaper.
*   **Core Pain Points:**
    *   **Dated UX:** It's search-heavy and category-heavy. It lacks the "feed" experience that Gen Z loves.
    *   **Slow & Serious:** It's great for selling a car or a fridge, but feels too "heavy" for selling a t-shirt or a cute bag.
    *   **Feature Bloat:** They are trying to do everything (Cars, Property, Jobs, Amulets), diluting the fashion experience.

### 3. Instagram Thrift Shops
*   **The "Manual" Hustle:** This is where the cool Gen Z stuff actually is right now.
*   **Core Pain Points:**
    *   **Fragmentation:** You have to follow 50 different shops to see good items.
    *   **"F" to Confirm:** The buying process is manual (DM to buy, send slip, wait for admin). It's slow and prone to "someone else got it first" frustration.
    *   **No Discovery:** If you don't follow the right shop, you never see the item.

### The ShopDer Opportunity (The "Gap")
*   **Trust:** Unlike FB, we can have a "held payment" system (money only goes to seller when item arrives).
*   **Discovery:** Unlike Kaidee, we show you things you didn't know you wanted (Swipe mechanic).
*   **Centralization:** Unlike Instagram, we bring all the cool thrift shops into one feed.
