## 3. The "Why" (Strategic Rationale)
*   **Recurring Revenue (MRR):** Subscriptions provide stable, predictable cash flow that investors value highly over fluctuating transaction fees.
*   **Incentive Alignment:**
    *   **Seed:** Low barrier to entry (Free) maximizes **User Acquisition**.
    *   **Sprout/Forest:** Encourages sellers to **invest** in the platform. Once they pay a monthly fee, they are incentivized to list more items to maximize their ROI (Lock-in Effect).
*   **Negative Churn:** As sellers grow successful, they naturally upgrade to higher tiers, increasing our revenue without needing to acquire new customers.

## 4. Key Metrics & Unit Economics
1.  **MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue):** Total revenue from subscriptions.
2.  **ARPU (Average Revenue Per User):** Combined revenue (Ads + Comm + Sub) divided by total active users.
3.  **CAC Payback Period:** Time required to recover the cost of acquiring a customer (e.g., if CAC is 100 THB and Sprout margin is 199 THB, payback is immediate).
4.  **Churn Rate:** The percentage of subscribers who cancel. We minimize this by providing undeniable value (0% commission for Forest tier).
